1. Introduction

Mental health refers to a state of psychological well-being that empowers individuals to manage life's challenges, recognize their potential, learn effectively, perform productively, and actively contribute to their communities. It is a fundamental aspect of overall health and well-being, supporting our capacity to make decisions, foster relationships, and influence the world around us. Mental health is a fundamental human right and plays a vital role in personal growth, community cohesion, and socio-economic progress.

How does clustering help in organizing data?

When you're trying to learn about something, say paintings, one approach might be to look for meaningful groups or collections. You might organize paintings by style, while your friend might organize them by the artistâ€™s era. How you choose to group items helps you to understand more about them as individual works of art. You might find that you have a deep appreciation for abstract art and further break down the style into different techniques or art from various regions. On the other hand, your friend might explore art from the Renaissance period and understand how it was influenced by the historical and cultural context. In both cases, you and your friend have learned something fascinating about art, even though you took different approaches. In machine learning too, we often group examples as a first step to understand a subject (data set) in a machine learning system. Grouping unlabeled examples is called clustering.

How can clustering improve mental health treatment outcomes?

People's needs evolve over time, especially throughout their treatment. A payment system for mental healthcare must accommodate the varying levels of care provided during fluctuating and unpredictable treatment episodes. To achieve this, it is crucial that individuals are not only assessed and grouped at the time of referral, but also reassessed and regrouped periodically. In practice, this means evaluating and clustering individuals at: 1- The conclusion of the initial assessment (usually within 2 contacts). 2- During all scheduled CPA or other formal care reviews. 3- At any point where a significant change in the planned care is required (e.g., unplanned reviews, emergency admissions, etc.). Organizations should clarify who is responsible for the clustering process, especially when multiple professionals are involved.

Used algoritm for this projec are:

MiniBatchKMeans: A faster variant of KMeans that uses small random batches for centroid updates.

Agglomerative Clustering: A hierarchical approach that merges clusters based on proximity, ideal for smaller datasets.

Birch: A scalable clustering algorithm designed for large datasets, which builds a tree-like structure to summarize the data.

DBSCAN: A density-based method that groups closely packed data points and identifies noise, without needing the number of clusters specified.

KMeans: A well-known partitioning algorithm that assigns data points to K predefined clusters based on their proximity to centroids.

MeanShift: A density-based algorithm that shifts data points toward regions of higher density, suitable for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes.

Spectral Clustering: A graph-based algorithm that uses eigenvalues of a similarity matrix for dimensionality reduction and then applies traditional clustering techniques like KMeans."
